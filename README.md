# Hi, I'm Gudmund 👋

## Optimizing performance — in training and in code.

I’m a Computer Science student and sprint kayaker (K1 / K4 500m) focused on one thing: **continuous optimization**.

On the water, that means refining every stroke.  
In software, that means refining every system.

## 🧠 Philosophy

I approach software the same way I approach elite sport:

- Measure what matters  
- Remove inefficiencies  
- Build tight feedback loops  
- Iterate relentlessly  

Performance is engineered — not hoped for.
