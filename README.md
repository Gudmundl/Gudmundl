##Hi, I'm Gudmund 👋

#Optimizing performance; in training and in code.

I’m a computer science student and sprint kayaker (K1 / K4 500m) focused on one thing:
continuous optimization.

On the water, that means refining every stroke.
In software, that means refining every system.

🚀 Current Focus

🎓 Group Bachelor Project
Using AI to optimize operational efficiency and quality of execution.
Working at the intersection of machine learning, systems thinking, and real-world performance improvement.

💻 Deepening my knowledge in:

Systems & networking

Performance engineering

Reliable transport protocols

Clean architecture & scalable design

🧠 Philosophy

I approach software the same way I approach elite sport:

Measure what matters

Remove inefficiencies

Build feedback loops

Iterate relentlessly

Performance is engineered — not hoped for.
